# ExCELL Routing Service

This routing service requires a latitude and longitude input for two locations to calculate the shortest route in between. The routing is based on the Dijkstra algorithm. The service acts as a wrapper around the well-known and powerful OpenStreetMap Routing Engine Graphhopper.

## Installation

This web service comes as a (SpringBoot)[https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/] application so it's very easy to test it on your local machine.
